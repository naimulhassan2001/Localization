    "bangladesh" : "Bangladesh is a wonderful land of natural beauty. The green forests of this beautiful country, vast mangrove forests, rivers, green hills, vast beaches, ancient historical and archaeological monuments have been attracting people who are eager to travel from different countries of the world for ages. Seeing the natural beauty of Bangladesh, the eyes widened. So the charmed, awe-struck poet called Bengali 'Rupsi Bangla' in his emotion-smooth accent. Beautiful Bangladesh is the land of six seasons. The country of 56 thousand square miles is like a museum of natural beauty. Its praise for its verdant nature has been echoed by poets for ages."
